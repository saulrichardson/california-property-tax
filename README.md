# Property Taxes in California
```
California's Prop 13 keeps the assessed value of any real property back at year it was last sold. They are not reassessed each year according to a property's
current market value. This can be a good thing for families who own and have lived in their house for a long time, but it also opens legal loopholes for others
to artificially keep their property taxes low even though it has changed hands. Golf clubs in Los Angeles use complex ownership structures to ensure that when
members buy stakes in the club, no more than a 50% interest changes hands. Commercial real estate can be sold without changing who is on the title by selling the
LLC that owns property instead of the property itself. Strategies like these can prevent properties from being reassessed and keep their tax bill incredibly low
relative to their actual market value.

This project aims to understand how disconnected property tax revenues and market values really are, especially in high-value areas where wealthy
individuals/corporations can take advantage of Prop 13. Our project will have the additional benefit of unifying local county property tax data into a single
mapâ€”something that doesn't exist at the state level.
